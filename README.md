# fenlason-hack
The original Hack source code submitted by Jay Fenlason and classmates for inclusion on the USENIX 1982-1 tape.

This program was written for a PDP-11 running BSD UNIX (probably BSD 2.8). 1982 was seven years before the first ANSI standard was adopted for the C language, so the C code for this program reflects the first edition of _The C Programming Language_ by Kernighan and Ritchie. What this means is that this code will not compile with any current ANSI-compliant C compilers. Also, most of the library calls are for BSD UNIX on the PDP-11 (and some, like sgtty.h, were obsolete even when Jay wrote Hack.)

This source code was created primarily by Jay Fenlason, with additional contributions from Kenny Woodland, Mike Thome, and Jon Payne. It is being shared here under a [CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), as that is the closest modern license to the original distribution license.
